# Spirogen
A web application for creating geometric visualizations and animations

## Disclaimer
This is a very fresh project that I am actively working on. The UI is in a rough draft state for the time-being, until I get final designs done. The feature-set is incomplete, some things are in an odd debugging state, and I don't have comprehensive instructions yet. That said, this is moving very quickly, and I hope to have all of these things cleaned up in the near future. I am keeping the source-code private for the time-being, as I am still considering whether there is business potential for this project, but, for anyone curious, the stack is Svelte, TypeScript, SASS, Node, & AWS. 

*Note: You may have been directed here from a reference to the legacy version of this project (tkinter Python application). That version has been moved [here](https://github.com/TheDitis/SpiroGen-Legacy)*

A LINK AND BASIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE POSTED SOON!
